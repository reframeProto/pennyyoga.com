            <h1>What sort of Yoga do i teach?</h1>
            <p>I teach a blend of Hatha yoga gleaned from my own experience of many teachers and yoga disciplines. Hatha yoga comes from a 6,000 year tradition initially used to help the ancient yogis keep fit, supple and strong enough to undertake long periods of meditation. In the west we are more inclined to use yoga as an exercise regime and that’s ok if you only want that. But it can also help you learn to focus both breath and mind to achieve a deeper level of awareness and inner calm. Living in todays busy and stressful world people might come to yoga wanting a stronger core or flexibility and then find that there is so much more that they can gain.</p>

            <h1>Why do yoga?</h1>
            <p>Many people do yoga initially for the physical aspect of wanting to get stronger, help gain flexibility or to learn to lessen stress etc. After a few weeks of practice they start to notice the physical asana can be enhanced with breath techniques. The combination of body and breath then allows the mind to zone in and calm down so that the session can be experienced in a mindful or meditative way.
              Allow 10 minutes of relaxation as well and suddenly people can start to discover a new way of being...you have to give it 4- 6 weeks to really experience what yoga can do.</p>

                  have found such a good teacher who is both compassionate and understanding to my particular

                  many variations to poses and routines to accommodate the wide range of experience levels in her
                  classes. I have not only begun to learn about balance, breathing and core strength, but I am
                  also beginning to find some peaceful time in my busy life during the relaxation element. I cannot

          <p>Come to class with an open mind and be prepared to find week 1 or 2 a little tricky as you watch and copy but don’t worry as this gets much easier in time. Do give yourself 4-6 weeks to really try yoga. It is an important part of the practice to make a commitment to yourself.</p>

        <p>I never fail to be amazed by how practicing yoga can transform peoples lives. There is something so magical in seeing a student start to "feel" the yoga poses, become empowered by the asana, the accompanying breath and subsequent change in mindset.<br><br>I recently was reminded about this when a client shyly told me after class that after a year of yoga she could feel herself change for the better. She had been dealing with grief and had found the space and stillness yoga can offer to "witness" how she was truly feeling and why. This can help negative emotions to lose their power over us and come into clearer perspective. She was developing her own "wisdom" and was now better able to stand back and see her own truth which was that she was more than the sum total of her grieving.<br><br>Other clients have whispered to me as they leave that they found coming to the class every week really helped them cope with what was happening outside of the practice and I as a teacher am humbled by these revelations.<br><br>
          When the newspapers are reporting that the benefits of yoga are weightloss it saddens me that this 6,000 year old practice can be belittled to calorie counting. Yes you may end up feeling so much better about yourself that you  want to eat better food wisely, rest well and nourish your body and mind but it offers so much more.<br><br>I am currently studying to become a Yoga Therapist which uses the yogic models of chakra and the 5 bodies to holistically help people come back to balance, it is amazing that something so ancient can be so very relevant today. People seem to feel that something is missing in their lives, yoga teaches us that everything we need is already within us. It doesn't matter about how old you are, what shape your in or if you can put your foot behind your head (and just for the record I can't) because yoga will meet you where ever you are and with practice will lead you to a better place.
          Transform yourself to the person you were meant to be with Hatha Yoga.<br><br>Love and light.</p>
